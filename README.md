# Tavolo

Reservation and table management platform for multi-location restaurant groups.

## Overview

Tavolo replaces the patchwork of OpenTable, Resy, pen-and-paper, and spreadsheets that restaurant groups use. We provide a single dashboard to manage reservations, waitlists, floor plans, and guest profiles across all locations.

## Key Features

- **Cross-Location Guest Intelligence**: Track diner preferences, visit history, and spending patterns across all locations. If a regular at the downtown location visits the new waterfront spot, the host already knows they prefer corner booths and are allergic to shellfish.

- **Unified Reservations**: Manage reservations across all locations from a single interface.

- **Floor Plan Management**: Import and manage floor plans with drag-and-drop table arrangement.

- **Analytics Dashboard**: Cross-location analytics with proper timezone handling for accurate daily reporting.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
